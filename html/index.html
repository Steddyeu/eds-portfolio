                  <h2>My Story</h2>
                  <p>
                   <strong> Hi, I'm Ed,</strong> I’m a former tech headhunter turned full stack software
                    developer in Manchester. After my dream of a military career was cut
                    short, I spent the next 4 years pursuing a career in sales.<br>
                    As time went on, I enjoyed sales less and less and knew it was not
                    my calling. I’d always had a love for language and writing, so I
                    decided to learn a new language that could possibly open new
                    doors.<br/>
                    I looked at French, Russian and Arabic when a friend recommended
                    learning a computer language as they would be the languages of the
                    future. From the moment I typed my first line of code:<br/>
                    <strong class="strong">
                      < p>Hello, I am learning to code < / p>
                    </strong>
                    I’ve was hooked.
                    <br/>It was what people call a quake moment, something that changes
                    everything, something that causes an earthquake within and awakens
                    the mind. As I began to teach myself code, I knew this is what I
                    wanted to do. The dye was cast, and all my days since have been
                    dedicated to becoming a developer and learning to code. <br>
                    Whether it be learning a new skills from scratch or forging a new
                    career. I am someone who has always been willing to follow through
                    their words and ideas with action. Whether it be joining the
                    military as a teenager, travelling to another continent on my own,
                    becoming a Samaritan, or starting my own business. I have always
                    been willing to take the plunge, pick up the gauntlet and have the
                    courage and determination to follow ideas and dreams until they
                    become a reality.

                  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Why Code?</strong> I love coding for the
                    same reason I love cooking and writing, it doesn’t matter how good
                    it is, its mine. I made it. I know what went into it and can be
                    proud of it. Its the act of writing and creating. Bringing thoughts
                    and ideas into reality. <br /><br />
                    I love how code blends both logic and creativity to create truly
                    amazing things. The fusion of logic and creativity spoke to me
                    because they are often seen as opposites or opponents, like a red
                    and blue team competing against each other. It is something I have
                    always refused to believe. But in the world of coding ,they work in
                    harmony and aid one other.
                    <br /><br />
                    As I taught myself HTML, CSS and javascript in preparation to join
                    the Northcoders training programme, the deeper i fell into the world
                    of coding, and the enchanting it became. The things I could build,
                    the ideas I could bring to life. Simply, it puts a fire in my belly,
                    hours can pass and I don’t even realise it.

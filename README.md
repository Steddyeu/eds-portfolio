# Eds-portfolio
font-awesome: ``` npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-free ```

All pages are fully responsive and can fit multiple screen sizes. 

# Nav bar
Responsive nav bar, which is fixed to the top of the page. 
There is a home button which makes use of cs-gradients and all links have a transition colour change when hovered over. 

I have made use of smooth scroll when links are clicked.

# Landing-page 
Lanfing page with an intro and an image. I have decided to keep the landing page simple and to the point as that is not where the main content is. 

# about me page
brief intro about myself, and my 'why' for coding. It is a fairly wordy page compared to the rest, I have done my best to distill all the information into short punch paragraphs that should make for swift reading and a button at the bottom of the page which leads to my CV. 

# skills

Two unordered lists showing technical skills using font awesome and third list, displaying soft skills. 
I decided to use images for the tech skills for easier visual digestion. 

Again a simple and uncluttered layout with minimal writing and effects. 
# Projects 

Consists of one main project at the top, and a slider containing further projects below. 

The slider was inspired from css tricks, where i reverse enginerred the code. It gives for a pleasing ux and also allows me to dissplay multiple projects without taking up too much space and still keeping the page clean and clear. 

# contact-me 
The contact me page contains anchored font awesome icons, that link to my github, email and linkedin. 
for ux, there is a transitional colour change when they hove over the icons.

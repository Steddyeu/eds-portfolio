    <h1>De-swap demo</h1>
    <p>De-Swap is a peer-to-peer social swapping app aimed at young people and works as a way of swapping items of clothing
    with other users.<br> I wanted to create an app that would be beneficial to a user in a number of ways,
    providing them with the opportunity to both help save the environment and the cash in their pockets, all from their
    phone.
</p>
<p>Users can access a general Marketplace of items up for ‘swaps’, and inspect the items to get details such as clothing
condition. Users can also upload pictures to our database of items they would like to offer or barter in a trade, and if
happy with the deal on the table, request to swap via out chat functionality. Just remember, before you give your old
clothes the drop, check out our App and give it a swap.
</p>
    <p>Due to de-swap being a react native app, my demo is in the form of a video. If you wish to run this on your phone or an emulator please follow the instructions in the README</p>

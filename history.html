    <h3 class='card-heading'>Personal Statement<h3>

        <p>
          I am former tech headhunter turned full stack software developer based in Manchester
              <br>
              <br>
              I graduated Northcoders award winning bootcamp and I am curerntly working and gaining experience as a Data Engineer
              <br>
              <br>I would
              be best suited
              in an environment that ranks culture, collaboration and continual training high on its agenda.
              <br><br>
              My time in sales has given me astute problem solving talents within the workplace, in particular, with a
              focus on
              perseverance and dedication in approaching daily tasks and difficulties in a methodical and logical
              manner.<br><br>
              Many of my previous roles have been target driven and high-pressured environments, requiring the ability
              to keep calm
              under pressure and using my initiative to react appropriately in the moment, to deliver the necessary
              results.
              <br><br>
              As a Samaritan I have learnt that theres more chance of finding 1000 lines of untested code that works
              than finding a
              great listener. Samaritans has equipped me with a deep understanding of what it means to listen to a
              person, and be a
              person others can trust.
              <br><br>
              With over three years of experience in the Royal Marine Reserves, I understand the importance of
              camaraderie with those
              you work with, humour in adverse situations, to be able to complete a job quickly yet efficiently with few
              resources or
              direction and to take complete responsibility for one’s own actions.<br><br> I pride myself on my ability to adapt
              and react to
              situations, both expected or unexpected, navigating around obstacles in order to seize the best course of
              action.
